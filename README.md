# Feverkill
Superior fan control for computers with SW + HW.

<br>
<br>

This repository contains:
  * Code for the Control Software (mostly C# .NET)
  * Code for AVR microcontrollers (which are the brain of the standalone fan controller hardware)
  * 3D models for the controller hardware and for some extra parts
  * Basic PCB designs for the controller hardware
  * Binary files

<br>
<br>

<p>The software is able to work and control mobo/GPU fans without the controller HW. You can just download and try it.<br>The controller HW is just an extra feature.</p>
